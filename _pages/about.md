Morgan is a PhD candidate at MIT. She is a member of the Multifuntional Metamaterials Laboratory, advised by [Dr. Svetlana Boriskina] (https://sboriskina.mit.edu/). Morgan studies nanophotonics and light-matter interaction, with applications in energy harvesting, photodetection, and non reciprocal transport. Morgan is supported by [Draper Labs](https://www.draper.com/) as a member of their scholars program.

Research focus
======
**Energy harvesting and photodetection** In this research I work on developing materials for infrared detection via strain engineering, utilizing the flexoelectric effect. This work addresses the need for efficient infrared detectors for energy generation via thermal radiation harvesting. This research has an experimental focus, working with 2d semiconductors and nanofabrication techniques to evaluate candidate materials for thermo-photovolatics. 

**Broken inversion symmetry and broken time-reversal symmetry materials** In this research I look at the non-reciprocal behaviors of materials via strain engineering and application of external fields. This work is modeling based, with work in Mathematica.

Interests
------
I am a distance runner with [Tracksmith's](https://www.tracksmith.com/) amateur [Boston Hares](https://www.strava.com/clubs/582006) team
