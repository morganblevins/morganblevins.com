Morgan is a PhD candidate at MIT. She is a member of the Multifuntional Metamaterials Laboratory, advised by [Dr. Svetlana Boriskina] (https://sboriskina.mit.edu/). Morgan studies nanophotonics and light-matter interaction, with applications in energy harvesting, photodetection, and non reciprocal transport. Morgan is supported by [Draper Labs](https://www.draper.com/) as a member of their scholars program.
