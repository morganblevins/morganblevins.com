* Graduate course, MIT, Mechanical Engineering, 2023
* Course development as well as Teaching Assistant duties for MIT Mechanical Engineering graduate level nanophotonics and metamaterials class with Prof. Svetlana Boriskina

"Provides a review of Maxwell's equations and the Helmholtz wave equation. Optical devices: waveguides and cavities, phase and group velocity, causality, and scattering. Light-matter interaction in bulk, surface, and subwavelength-structured matter. Effective media, dispersion relationships, wavefronts and rays, eikonal description of light propagation, phase singularities. Transformation optics, gradient effective media. Includes description of the experimental tools for realization and measurement of photonic materials and effects. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments."


Optics and Photonics (6.6310) Teaching Assistant
======
* Graduate course, MIT, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 2022
* Teaching Assistant for MIT EECS graduate level Optics and Photonics with Prof. James Fujimoto

"Introduction to fundamental concepts and techniques of optics, photonics, and fiber optics, aimed at developing skills for independent research. Topics include: Review of Maxwell's equations, light propagation, reflection and transmission, dielectric mirrors and filters. Scattering matrices, interferometers, and interferometric measurement. Fresnel and Fraunhoffer diffraction theory. Lenses, optical imaging systems, and software design tools. Gaussian beams, propagation and resonator design. Optical waveguides, optical fibers and photonic devices for encoding and detection. Discussion of research operations / funding and professional development topics. The course reviews and introduces mathematical methods and techniques, which are fundamental in optics and photonics, but also useful in many other engineering specialties."
