permalink: /publication/2021-05-12-High-Contrast-Probe-Cleavage
excerpt: 'In this Letter, we evaluate the performance of an integrated microring photonic biosensor using the high contrast cleavage detection (HCCD) mechanism, which we recently introduced. The HCCD sensors make use of dramatic optical signal amplification caused by the cleavage of large numbers of high-contrast nanoparticle reporters instead of the adsorption of labeled or unlabeled low-index biological molecules.'
